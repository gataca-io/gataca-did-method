# Gataca DID Method Specification
V0.2, Gataca

## Introduction
GATACA is a blockchain-based digital identity platform that provides Identity and Access Management (IAM) services using decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials.

The new architecture inverts the fundamentals of authentication management by putting the user at the center of identity issuance and control. With a digital wallet on their phones, users can obtain, store, and manage identity credentials from issuers worldwide - including governmental credentials - in a standard, recognized, and trusted digital format.

Instead of hundreds of siloed and scattered identities, each servicing a specific purpose, users can now build a database of interoperable identity credentials that they can selectively share to securely authenticate any public or private digital service worldwide. 

Gataca uses the specifications provided by the W3C in order to maximize interoperability between the different agents globally. [DID documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [Verifiable Credentials documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). 

## Infrastructure
Gataca’s platform is based on a mobile identity portfolio, a set of APIs, and controllers for multiple blockchain networks. 

Gataca is agnostic to the blockchain network used, a key differentiator relative to other providers. We adapt our infrastructure to the third party’s preferred ledger. Gataca currently provides services to use Ethereum (Mainnet, Rinkeby, Robsten, and private networks using Hyperledger Besu as a client), Hyperledger Fabric for private networks, and Alastria, Corda, Bitcoin, LacChain are in the current roadmap.

## Overview
In this application, we provide the Ethereum Smart Contract to read all DID documents we have in the DEV environment. Gataca also provides a Chaincode to read information deployed in HLF private networks.

The simple structure links an object to a DID with states and public keys. Users do not need privileges to read the information on the blockchain but do need them to write. Gataca is the unique user that can modify the smart contract.

## Specification
### Method DID Format
Gataca uses the following rules
```
did                = "did:" method-name ":" method-specific-id
method-name        = "gatc"
method-specific-id = ^[a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z1-9]{32}$
```
Definitions:
- **did**: Indicates it is a decentralized identifier
- **method-name**: Gataca uses *gatc* as its method identifier
- **identifier**: Identifier is a chain of 32 characters using base 58

### Operations
Gataca provides four basic operations to manage DIDs. Using the backend platform a user can create a new DID with their public key, can read the previous DID generated by themselves or created by other users, and users can modify to temporarily suspend one of their DIDs or revoke it permanently (logical deletion).
#### Create
To create a new DID, users need to access the Gataca Identity app (Identity wallet). The wallet generates a key pair associated with that DID, and it sends the DID and public key to the Gataca Backbone (middleware to communicate to DLTs). The private key is stored in a mobile device’s secure storage.
#### Read
Users need to use the Gataca Backbone with DID to read it. This access is free.
#### Suspend
To suspend a DID, users need to have privileged access to the Gataca Backbone. Users can only modify their own DIDs. If the DID has been suspended, it cannot be read. To recover it, the user needs to re-activate it.
#### Revoke
To revoke a DID, users need to have privileged access to Gataca Backbone. Users can only modify their own DIDs. If the DID has been revoked, it cannot be read or modified.

## Security Considerations
### Crypto algorithms
Gataca platform is capable of using different crypto algorithms, but by default, it uses ED25519 as it is one of the fastest and most secure algorithms for digital signatures. This feature provides Gataca the functionality to change the algorithm dynamically, adapting the platform to new features or breaks. However, Gataca can adapt its algorithms according to client needs.
### AuthNFactors
Gataca uses security mechanisms to ensure the device and wallet owner are the same. AuthNFactors use the same structure as verifiable credentials, but its mechanisms ensure wallet and device ownership consistency by using challenges to verify authentication rather than storing information about the user.
### Consents - Anonymous relationship
Gataca’s consent approval is a distinct advantage. The consent structure provides evidence that the user and the verifier agree to share information between them. Importantly, the user uses a new DID relationship to anonymize his data, without sharing his root DID.
## Privacy Considerations
### DID-Relationship
Gataca users have a root DID that acts as their global identifier, but they have multiple DIDs related to each verifier relationship. This architecture provides anonymity to the user, protecting his root DID from hackers and inference processes. Additionally, this enables users to easily revoke access to their data.
 
### GDPR Compliance
Gataca is GDPR compliant. Gataca only stores public information in DLTs (DPKI). Gataca uses DLTs to provide integrity and resiliency and to act as a trusted third party, maintaining user privacy.
